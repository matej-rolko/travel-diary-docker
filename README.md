# Contact Manager App

This is a Node.js-based Contact Manager application where users can register, authenticate, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their contacts. The app handles user authentication, data validation, and ensures that contacts are managed in a secure manner with token-based authentication.

## Features

- User Registration & Login
- Authentication via JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- CRUD operations for managing contacts
- Secure API access, allowing only authenticated users to interact with their own contacts
- Validation of cross-user access to prevent unauthorized modifications to other users' contacts
- Error handling and appropriate status codes for different scenarios
- Docker support for easy setup and deployment

## Technology Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Docker & Docker Compose
